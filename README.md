Learning Compressed Version of Images with Auto Encoders
main.py: Contains the full pipeline — dataset loading, model initialization, training loop, evaluation, saving outputs.

model.py: Defines the convolutional autoencoder class.

utils.py: For helper functions like:

Loading datasets

Visualizing reconstructions

Computing loss metrics

outputs/: To keep your results organized.

README.md: For documentation — helpful even for yourself later.

➕ Optional Additions (Only If Needed Later)
notebooks/: For trying things out interactively.

config.py or a dict: If hyperparameter tuning gets messy.
